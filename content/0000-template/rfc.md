## Problem

[Insert a one- or two-paragraph explanation of the underlying product or
engineering problem this RFC addresses.]

## Summary

[Insert a one- or two-paragraph explanation of this proposed change.]

## Motivation

[Why should we include this change in the product? How does it solve the problem
described? How does it help customers be more successful? Include rationale for
prioritizing this change in a product backlog.]

## Product-level explanation

[Explain this change in a way that our product team can understand it and pitch
it to customers for feedback. Make heavy use of examples and ensure you
introduce any new concepts at a high level.]

## Engineering-level explanation

[Explain, in detail, the technical manifestation of this change. Detail the
scope of work including time or size estimates. Include any potential conflicts
with features that are currently underway.]

### Deliverables

[If the scope of the work in this RFC is to take longer than a single
engineering sprint, include specific deliverables, ideally one or more for each
sprint. Ensure each deliverable represents a complete, usable piece of
functionality, not just a work stream or list of tasks.]

* [Insert date of deliverable, in T+*X* weeks format]: [Describe the
  deliverable, including changes and refactors required from previous
  deliverables.]

### Operational impact

[Does this work require changes to our infrastructure or operations? Include any
increase or decrease to security surface areas or additional requirements for
system metrics and monitoring.]

## Rationale and alternatives

### Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

[Describe the benefits, both to product and engineering, by implementing this
solution. Include a comparison of alternative designs as part of the narrative
if possible.]

### What is the impact of not doing this?

[...]

## Drawbacks

[Why should we _not_ include this change in the product? What specific risks are
associated with this design?]

## Success criteria

[What will we observe when this change is completely implemented? What product
metrics can we use to measure success? Can we integrate any learnings into
future processes?]

## Unresolved questions

* [Insert a list of unresolved questions and your strategy for addressing them
  before the change is complete. Include potential impact to the scope of work.]

## Future possibilities

[Does this change unlock other desired functionality? Will it be highly
extensible, very constrained, or somewhere in between?]
